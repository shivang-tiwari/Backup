# Backup
This is a backup of my linux setup.
## Gtk theme
To install my gtk-theme, unzip it and paste it in the `.themes` folder. To use this, you must have gnome-tweaks installed. Go to gnome-tweaks/Appearance and select my gtk-theme.
## Geany setup
Paste `snippets.conf`, `filetypes.cpp` and `geany.css` in the respective folders.
## Competetive programming
All of my algorithms are in the `snippets.conf` file. Some extra stuff is mentioned here.
### Croupier
Croupier links the stdin of one program to the stdout of other. To run configure run these commands in the terminal.
```sh
chmod 777 A
chmod 777 test
chmod +x run.sh
```
Now enter this command to run croupier
```sh
./run.sh
```
### Snippet Maker
This makes a snippet for use in geany. To use it, paste the entire snippet code to the stdin of the program and the snippet will be printed in the output.txt file.
## Bash commands
I have made a lot of bash files and aliases.
### Class schedule
Running `padhai.sh` takes you to the meet of the ongoing class depending on the time and day of the week. Class links can be specified in the variables on the top of the code.
### Aliases
My `.bashrc` file is also uploaded here.
